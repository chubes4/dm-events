Frontend-focused WordPress events plugin with block-first architecture. Integrates with Data Machine plugin for automated event imports and AI-driven event publishing.

== Description ==

**Data Machine Events** is a modern WordPress events plugin built with a **block-first architecture**. It provides elegant event display and management through Gutenberg blocks while integrating seamlessly with the Data Machine plugin for automated event imports and AI-driven content creation.

= Key Features =

**🏗️ Block-First Architecture**
* **Single Source of Truth:** All event data (date, time, venue, price, etc.) is managed directly within the `Event Details` block in the Gutenberg editor.
* **No More Meta Boxes:** This modern approach eliminates the need for cumbersome custom fields and meta boxes, creating an intuitive editing experience.
* **Optimized for Performance:** Key data, like the event start time, is automatically synced to a meta field in the background, ensuring fast and efficient calendar queries.

**🚀 Data Machine Integration**
* Automated event imports from Ticketmaster, Dice FM, and web scrapers
* AI-driven event creation with smart descriptions and taxonomy assignments
* Seamless venue management with automatic term creation
* Background processing for optimal performance

**🎯 API Integrations (via Data Machine)** 
* **Ticketmaster API** - Live Nation integration with API key authentication
* **Dice FM API** - Independent venue and event coverage
* **Web Scrapers** - Custom scrapers for specific venues
* **Flexible Data Sources** - Extensible handler system for additional sources

**⚡ Lightweight & Modern**
* **Gutenberg-First:** All event data is managed via blocks, not custom meta boxes.
* Single custom post type vs. 50+ database tables (Tribe Events)
* REST API enabled for headless implementations
* Clean, modern codebase following WordPress standards

**🎨 Complete Frontend System**
* **Gutenberg-Powered:** The entire frontend, including the calendar and event details, is rendered using native Gutenberg blocks.
* Beautiful calendar interface with list and grid views.
* Modern, responsive event displays.
* Advanced filtering and real-time search.
* Event detail pages with schema markup.

**🔧 WordPress Native Integration**
* Single `dm_events` post type with venue taxonomy
* Comprehensive venue meta fields (10 fields: address, phone, website, capacity, coordinates, etc.)
* REST API enabled for headless implementations
* Block-first approach with background meta field sync for performance
* Legacy status detection monitors removed (class retained as compatibility stub)
